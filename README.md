## Hi there, my name is Michèle 👋

### I am a strategic designer and passionate about brand & product management.

- 🤓 I am currently doing my full stack web development bootcamp 👩🏼‍💻 at the [spiced academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/de).
- 🧡 I did my master's degree in strategic design and my bachelor's degree in communication design; both at the [Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/).
- 🧘‍♀️ In my free time I love doing yoga.
- 🌱 I am also a very active person and like to spend time in the nature, for example to go skiing with friends and family. ⛷
- 💬 Ask me about how to cook healthy … I have already created plenty of recipes for easy dishes. 🥗
